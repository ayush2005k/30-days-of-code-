TASK
Write a Person class with an instance variable, , and a constructor that takes an integer, 
as a parameter. The constructor must assign  to  after confirming the argument passed as  is not negative; 
if a negative argument is passed as , the constructor should set  to  and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1 .
amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
If age<=13 , print You are young..
If age>=13  and <18 , print You are a teenager..
Otherwise, print You are old..

CODE 
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Person {
    private int age;

    // Constructor
    public Person(int initialAge) {
        if (initialAge < 0) {
            age = 0;
            System.out.println("Age is not valid, setting age to 0.");
        } else {
            age = initialAge;
        }
    }

    // Method to determine the age group
    public void amIOld() {
        if (age < 13) {
            System.out.println("You are young.");
        } else if (age >= 13 && age < 18) {
            System.out.println("You are a teenager.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("You are old.");
        }
    }

    // Method to increment age
    public void yearPasses() {
        age++;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int T = sc.nextInt(); // Number of test cases

        for (int i = 0; i < T; i++) {
            int age = sc.nextInt();
            Person p = new Person(age);
            p.amIOld();
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                p.yearPasses();
            }
            p.amIOld();
            System.out.println();
        }
        sc.close();
    }
}
